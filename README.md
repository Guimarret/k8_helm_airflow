# Airflow Infrastructure with Kubernetes, Helm, Nix, Redis, and PostgreSQL

This project provides infrastructure setup for running Apache Airflow on Kubernetes. It utilizes Helm for managing Kubernetes applications, Nix for environment setup, and employs Redis and PostgreSQL as backend services.

## Overview

This project aims to streamline the deployment and management of Apache Airflow on Kubernetes clusters. By leveraging Helm charts, Nix for environment configuration, and integrating Redis and PostgreSQL, users can easily deploy Airflow for their workflow orchestration needs.

## Components

- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates containerized applications and provides scalable infrastructure.
- **Helm**: Simplifies the management of Kubernetes applications through package management.
- **Nix**: Facilitates environment setup and dependency management for consistent deployments.
- **Redis**: Acts as a backend service for Airflow to handle task queuing and result storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: Provides the database backend for Airflow to store metadata and task state.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Environment**: Use Nix to set up the environment with required dependencies.

3. **Deploy Airflow**: Use Helm to deploy Airflow on your Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Access Airflow UI**: Access the Airflow web interface to manage workflows and tasks.
